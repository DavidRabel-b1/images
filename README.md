# Documentation

To make changes in this repository, open a pull request. To prioritize the import of a new image send an email to
`support@betacloud.io` with reference to the created pull request.

## Add image

* only freely accessible community images may be added
* currently, the decompression of images, as with CoreOS, is not supported
* if there is no section for the product / distribution then create it accordingly
* explicitly mark `os_version` as a string to prevent evaluation as a double
* useful metadata keys can be found at https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/useful-image-properties.html
* possible values for `os_distro` can be found in libosinfo: https://gitlab.com/libosinfo/osinfo-db/tree/master/data/os or `osinfo-query os` (omit `os_distro` if there is no meaningful value for it)
* `min_disk` and `min_ram` should always be specified (keys do not have to be set, by default the values are 0)
* At `login` specify the user with whom you can log in after the initial start. This is necessary for the generated documentation as well as later automatic tests.

    os_distro: fedora
    os_version: '28'
```

### Naming convention

* names must be unique
* use the full name of the product / distribution, no shortcuts
* with one-time releases and a static image: add the release identifier
  * the image will be built once after a release and will not be updated later
* with one-time releases and a dynamic image: add the release identifier + add the build timestamp (`YYYYMMDD`)
  * the image is built after a release and rebuilt later, for example, to import updates

#### Good names

* `Ubuntu 16.04 (20180628)`
* `CoreOS 1632.3.0`

#### Bad names

* `Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus)` or `Ubuntu 16.04`
* `Debian 8`

## Delete image

* not implemented yet

## Modify image properties/tags

* management of tags not yet possible
* removal of properties is not yet possible
* URL, name and format can not be changed
* any keys can be added to `meta`, these will be added to the image
* existing keys in `meta` can be changed, the same applies to `min_disk` and `min_ram`

## Deactivate/reactivate image

* deactivation: change `status` to `deactivated`
* reactivation: change `status` to `active`

## Visibility

* https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html --> `Image visibility`
