With this script it is possible to easily manage and keep up to date a large number of images on an OpenStack environment.
We use this script to maintain the images on our public cloud Betacloud.

# Usage

## Add new image

* only freely accessible community images may be added
* currently, the decompression of images, as with CoreOS, is not supported
* if there is no section for the product / distribution then create it accordingly
* explicitly mark `os_version` as a string to prevent evaluation as a double
* useful metadata keys can be found at https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/useful-image-properties.html
* possible values for `os_distro` can be found in libosinfo: https://gitlab.com/libosinfo/osinfo-db/tree/master/data/os or `osinfo-query os` (omit `os_distro` if there is no meaningful value for it)
* `min_disk` and `min_ram` should always be specified (keys do not have to be set, by default the values are 0)
* At `login` specify the user with whom you can log in after the initial start. This is necessary for the generated documentation as well as later automatic tests.

### Image with regular rebuilds

```yaml
- name: Ubuntu 16.04
  format: qcow2
  login: ubuntu
  min_disk: 8
  min_ram: 512
  status: active
  visibility: public
  multi: true
  meta:
    architecture: x86_64
    hw_disk_bus: scsi
    hw_scsi_model: virtio-scsi
    hw_watchdog_action: reset
    os_distro: ubuntu
    os_version: '16.04'
  tags: []
  versions:
    20180928:
      url: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/20180928/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
    20181004:
      url: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/20181004/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
```

This configuration creates the following images:

* ``Ubuntu 16.04 (20180928)``
* ``Ubuntu 16.04``

If a newer build is added, the following rotation takes place:

* ``Ubuntu 16.04`` becomes ``Ubuntu 16.04 (20181004)``
* the new image becomes ``Ubuntu 16.04``

### Image without regular rebuild

```yaml
# RancherOS

- name: RancherOS
  format: qcow2
  login: rancher
  min_disk: 8
  min_ram: 2048
  status: active
  visibility: public
  multi: false
  meta:
    architecture: x86_64
    hw_disk_bus: scsi
    hw_scsi_model: virtio-scsi
    hw_watchdog_action: reset
  tags: []
  versions:
    1.3.0:
      url: https://github.com/rancher/os/releases/download/v1.3.0/rancheros-openstack.img
    1.4.0:
      url: https://github.com/rancher/os/releases/download/v1.4.0/rancheros-openstack.img
    1.4.1:
      url: https://github.com/rancher/os/releases/download/v1.4.1/rancheros-openstack.img
```

This configuration creates the following images:

* ``RancherOS 1.3.0``
* ``RancherOS 1.4.0``
* ``RancherOS 1.4.1``

If a new version is added, no rotation takes place. The new version is added as ``RancherOS x.y.z``.

### Naming convention

* names must be unique
* use the full name of the product / distribution, no shortcuts

Samples:

* `Ubuntu 16.04`
* `CoreOS`

## Delete image

* not implemented yet

## Modify image properties

* removal of properties is not yet possible
* URL, name and format can not be changed
* any keys can be added to `meta`, these will be added to the image
* existing keys in `meta` can be changed, the same applies to `min_disk` and `min_ram`

## Modify image tags

* add or remove tags to the ``tags`` list

## Deactivate/reactivate image

* deactivation: change `status` to `deactivated`
* reactivation: change `status` to `active`

## Visibility

* https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html --> `Image visibility`

* public: set `visibility` to `public`
* community: set `visibility` to `community`
* shared: set `visibility` to `shared`
* private: set `visibility` to `private`
